# formfun

A basic simple lite PHP, HTML, Javascript form with a "save and continue" option.

It seems it is almost there...

Haven't seen a lot of really basic options out there for this functionality.  Could improve the validation, security and UI/UX quite a bit.

Gave up with sql option after hours going around in circles with Claude and perplexity.  Getting better with prompting.  
They seem to lack being able to provide full working code examples and often leave a lot out.  Lazy AI, passive aggressive AI, overworked AI?

Nevermind that.

Here is a basic start for a simple online form option with a save and continue functionality.

This method generates a token, sends token url to user email with saved form data. <br>
User can go back to form url and continue form with data. <br>
Currently the submit button is kind of broken... <br>
it's getting late...  <br>
This could also include an sql option at some point but simplicity seems to maybe do the trick.
